# US Health Insurance Project

This project aims to analyze a Kaggle dataset on health insurance charges in the United States. Using machine learning algorithms, the goal is to predict the insurance charges based on various features such as age, BMI, region, and smoking status.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. It contains various features related to individuals' health insurance and the charges incurred. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset).

## Overview
The project includes the following key components:
- **Data Analysis**: A comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of data and perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - **Linear Regression**: A simple linear model to predict charges.
  - **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble learning algorithm for better accuracy.
  - **XGBoost**: A powerful boosting model known for high performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook and HTML**: The code used to load, clean, and analyze the dataset, as well as to train the machine learning models. Both the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and its HTML version are included in a ZIP file named **insurance**.
- **Power BI Report (.pbix format)**: A Power BI report that visualizes the results and insights obtained from the dataset and model predictions.

## Files Included
- **insurance.zip**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and its HTML version.
- **insurance_report.pbix**: The Power BI report file that contains visualizations based on the dataset and model predictions.
